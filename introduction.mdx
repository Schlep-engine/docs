# Welcome to Schlep-engine

Schlep-engine is a sophisticated ML inference routing platform that intelligently routes LLM requests across multiple AI providers using Thompson Sampling optimization.

## What is Schlep-engine?

Schlep-engine acts as an intelligent gateway between your applications and multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, and more). It automatically selects the best provider for each request based on:

- **Latency** - Response time performance
- **Cost** - Provider pricing and your budget
- **Quality** - Success rates and error handling
- **Availability** - Provider health and capacity

## Key Features

```

## Use Cases

### 1. Cost Optimization
Automatically route to the most cost-effective provider while maintaining quality thresholds.

### 2. Latency Optimization
Minimize response times by selecting the fastest provider for your geographic region.

### 3. Multi-Tenant SaaS
Build a multi-tenant AI application with secure key management and per-tenant budgets.

### 4. Fallback & Resilience
Automatic failover to alternative providers when primary providers experience issues.

### 5. Enterprise Multi-Tenancy
Build SaaS applications with complete tenant isolation, encrypted key storage (BYOK), per-tenant budgets, and comprehensive audit logging.

### 6. Budget Protection
Prevent cost overruns with automatic budget enforcement, token limits, and configurable fallback to free benchmark providers.
